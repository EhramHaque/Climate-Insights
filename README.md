# Climate-Insights
The main goal is to examine climate data and provide insight into patterns, trends, and potential impacts. Using the data, I intend to uncover valuable information about our changing climate and its effects. Through this analysis, I aim to provide information that can help make informed decisions and address climate change challenges.
I will collect and clean climate data from reliable sources and preprocess data to ensure its quality. Afterward, I will analyze various data sets to uncover meaningful patterns and trends, including calculating statistics like mean, maximum, and standard deviation. I intend to create appealing and informative visuals to present my findings.
